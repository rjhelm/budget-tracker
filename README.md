## About

This application follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. We have a clean codebase that is easy to follow and allows our data to be clearly defined. With everything organized and clear, debugging errors that occured were easy to identify.

- Model: The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

- View: Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

- Controller: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
